      <p><strong>Hi</strong>, my name is Andrew and welcome to my site.</p>
      <p>I have lived in the Seattle area my entire life, attending a cummunity college north of the city.  After getting an Associate in Fine Arts Degree I decided against continuing with pursuing a 4 year degree.  Instead I pursued career possibilities in Real Estate.  Though I had chosen to not pursue a traditional schooling experience in favor of work, I continued to pursue alternative educational avenues in my free time - Chief among them being web developemnet. </p>
